# MNIST Classification Model with PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a CNN model for MNIST digit classification that meets specific architectural and performance requirements.

## Model Architecture Requirements

The model is designed and tested to meet the following requirements:

1. **Parameter Count** ✓
   - Total parameters must be less than 20,000
   - Current model: 4,088 parameters
   - Verified using `test_parameter_count()` in test.py

2. **Batch Normalization** ✓
   - Must use Batch Normalization layers
   - Current model: Uses BatchNorm2d after each convolution
   - Verified using `test_batch_norm_usage()` in test.py

3. **Dropout** ✓
   - Must implement Dropout for regularization
   - Current model: Uses Dropout(0.15) at multiple stages
   - Verified using `test_dropout_usage()` in test.py

4. **Global Average Pooling** ✓
   - Must use GAP instead of fully connected layers
   - Current model: Uses AdaptiveAvgPool2d
   - Verified using `test_gap_usage()` in test.py

5. **Performance Requirements** ✓
   - Must achieve 99.4% validation accuracy
   - Must achieve this within 20 epochs
   - Uses 50k/10k train-validation split
   - Verified using `train_and_validate()` in test.py

## Test Cases

The model undergoes rigorous testing through GitHub Actions workflow. Here are the test cases:

### 1. Architecture Tests
```python
def test_parameter_count(model):
    # Ensures model has < 20k parameters
    total_params = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())
    assert total_params < 20000
```

### 2. Layer Tests
```python
def test_batch_norm_usage(model):
    # Verifies BatchNorm usage
    has_bn = any(isinstance(m, torch.nn.BatchNorm2d) for m in model.modules())
    assert has_bn

def test_dropout_usage(model):
    # Verifies Dropout usage
    has_dropout = any(isinstance(m, torch.nn.Dropout) for m in model.modules())
    assert has_dropout

def test_gap_usage(model):
    # Verifies Global Average Pooling usage
    has_gap = any(isinstance(m, torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d) for m in model.modules())
    assert has_gap
```

### 3. Performance Test
```python
def train_and_validate(model, device, train_loader, val_loader, epochs=20):
    # Trains model and verifies:
    # - 99.4% validation accuracy
    # - Achieved within 20 epochs
    # Returns: best_accuracy, epochs_taken
```

## Model Architecture Details

```python
# Input Block (28x28x1 → 28x28x10)
Conv2d(1, 10, 3, padding=1)
BatchNorm2d(10)

# First Block (28x28x10 → 14x14x16)
Conv2d(10, 16, 3, padding=1)
BatchNorm2d(16)
MaxPool2d(2, 2)
Dropout(0.15)

# Second Block with Residual (14x14x16 → 7x7x16)
Conv2d(16, 16, 3, padding=1)
BatchNorm2d(16)
Conv2d(16, 16, 3, padding=1)
BatchNorm2d(16)
MaxPool2d(2, 2)
Dropout(0.15)

# Third Block (7x7x16 → 7x7x32)
Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1)
BatchNorm2d(32)
Dropout(0.15)

# Output Block (7x7x32 → 10)
AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)
Conv2d(32, 10, 1)
```
